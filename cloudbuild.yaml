# This Cloud Build configuration builds a Docker image and pushes it to Google Container Registry (GCR).

steps:
  # Step 1: Build the Docker Image
  # This step uses the 'docker' builder to build your Docker image.
  # The '-t' flag tags the image with the full path for your Google Container Registry.
  # The '.' indicates that the Dockerfile is in the current directory.
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    args: [
      'build',
      '-t',
      'gcr.io/disco-beach-461517-m5/react-image:latest', # Tagging for Google Container Registry
      '.'
    ]

  # Step 2: Push the Docker Image to Google Container Registry
  # This step uses the 'docker' builder again to push the previously built and tagged image
  # to your specified GCR path. Cloud Build is automatically
  # authenticated to push to GCR within the same project.
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    args: [
      'push',
      'gcr.io/disco-beach-461517-m5/react-image:latest' # Pushing to Google Container Registry
    ]

# You can optionally specify a `timeout` for the entire build process.
# timeout: '1200s' # 20 minutes (uncomment to enable)

# You can also specify an `images` field to output the names of the images built,
# which can be useful for subsequent steps or for viewing in the Cloud Build UI.
# images:
#   - 'gcr.io/disco-beach-461517-m5/react-image:latest' # Uncomment to enable image output

# Removed logsBucket as requested.
# Using 'options' to control logging behavior, specifically default_logs_bucket_behavior.
options:
  # Use regional user-owned buckets for logs. This requires your project to have
  # been configured for regional logging buckets. If this option doesn't work
  # or if you prefer Cloud Logging only, you can use 'logging: CLOUD_LOGGING_ONLY'.
  default_logs_bucket_behavior: REGIONAL_USER_OWNED_BUCKET
  # Alternatively, send logs only to Cloud Logging (no GCS bucket for logs)
  # logging: CLOUD_LOGGING_ONLY
  # Or, disable all logging (not recommended for debugging)
  # logging: NONE
